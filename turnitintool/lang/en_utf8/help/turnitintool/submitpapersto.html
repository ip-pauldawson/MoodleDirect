This setting provides instructors with the ability to select whether papers are stored in a Turnitin student paper repository. The benefit of submitting papers to the student paper repository is that student papers submitted to the assignment are checked against other students\' submissions within your current and previous classes. If you select "no repository", your students\' papers will not be stored in the Turnitin student paper repository.
