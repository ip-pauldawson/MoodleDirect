<body><h2>INSTALLING THE TURNITIN MOODLE ACTIVITY MODULE</h2>
<hr />
<p>This module is installed in the standard way, instructions on how to install an activity module in Moodle can be found here:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_contributed_modules_or_plugins">http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_contributed_modules_or_plugins</a></blockquote>
<p>In order for the module to work correctly you must enable support for cURL in your php.ini file. To do this locate the following line in your php.ini file:</p>
<blockquote>;extension=php_curl.dll<br />
<b><i>OR</i></b><br />
;extension=php_curl.so</blockquote>
<p>Remove the semi-colon at the start of the line to activate the php cURL extension. Once you have done this you will need to restart your web server service.</p>
<p>More information on cURL and more detailed instructions for installing it can be found here:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://uk3.php.net/curl">http://uk3.php.net/curl</a></blockquote>
<p>If cURL has an out of date (or no) CA certificates, the interaction with Turnitin will fail due to cURL performing peer SSL certificate verification and not being able to verify the Turnitin SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Until cURL 7.18.0 some CA certificates were provided, but after 7.18.0 no cs certificates have been provided at all. Because of this, the Moodle server administrator would need to ensure that an up to date CA certificate bundle is used. To be clear, Moodle doesn't need an SSL certificate, however, it needs to have the certificate bundle in place so cURL can recognize the SSL certificates of Turnitin.</p>

<p>Information on how to install a certificate bundle is available via the URLs below. Note that the URLs are third party sites and not affiliated with Turnitin or iParadigms in any way:</p>
